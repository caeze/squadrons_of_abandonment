 - Emerald Empire (green) - vicious surveillance state, indoctrinated soldiers that rather die than flee, fewer units but strong (like CoH Wehrmacht)
 - Red Republic (red) - misdirected deteriorated communists, soldiers forced to serve that flee easily, many weak units (like CoH America)
 - Golden Garrison (yellow) - makeshift ruthless rebellion, idealists that are trained well and are experts in guerilla tactics, units fragile but high damage output (like CoH Panzer Elite)
 - Cyan Conglomerate (blue) - corrupt uncompassionate bankers, mercenary army with diverse abilities but morale issues, medium amount of medium strong units (like CoH Britain)

Core ships (space stations) spawn and come with two minigun defense towers and one pioneer scout
